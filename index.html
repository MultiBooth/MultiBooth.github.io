      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This paper introduces MultiBooth, a novel and efficient technique for
        multi-concept customization in image generation from text. Despite the
        significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly
        with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle
        with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high
        inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the
        multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept
        learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the
        single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and
        an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and
        discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept
        integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area
        for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the
        creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby
        facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not
        only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference
        cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and
        quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and
        computational efficiency.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Given a series of images that represent some concepts of interest, the
        goal of multi-concept customization (MCC) is to generate images that
        include any number of concepts in various styles, contexts, layout
        relationship as specified by given text prompts.
      </p>

      />
      <br />
      <p>
        The overall pipeline of MultiBooth can be devided into two phase: (a)
        During the single-concept learning phase, a multi-modal encoder and LoRA
        parameters are trained to encode every single concept. (b) During the
        multi-concept integration phase, the customized embeddings S* and V* are
        converted into text embeddings, which are then combined with the
        corresponding LoRA parameters to form single-concept modules. These
        single-concept modules, along with the bounding boxes, are intended to
        serve as input for the regional customization module.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Here we demonstrate the customized images generated by different
        methods. We qualitatively compare our approach with the most recent
        open-sourced state-of-the-art customization methods, including Textual
        Inversion, DreamBooth, Custom Diffusion and Cones2.

        We visualize the impact of removing specific components from our

      <h2>Text-Guided View Synthesis</h2>
      <p>
        Our technique can synthesized images with specified viewpoints for a
        subject cat (left to right: top, bottom, side and back views). Note that
        the generated poses are different from the input poses, and the
        background changes in a realistic manner given a pose change. We also
        highlight the preservation of complex fur patterns on the subject cat's
        forehead.

      <p>
        We show color modifications in the first row (using prompts ``a [color]
        [V] car''), and crosses between a specific dog and different animals in
        the second row (using prompts ``a cross of a [V] dog and a [target
        species]''). We highlight the fact that our method preserves unique
        visual features that give the subject its identity or essence, while
        performing the required property modification.

      <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This project aims to provide users with an effective tool for
        synthesizing personal subjects (animals, objects) in different contexts.
        While general text-to-image models might be biased towards specific
        attributes when synthesizing images from text, our approach enables the
        user to get a better reconstruction of their desirable subjects. On
        contrary, malicious parties might try to use such images to mislead
        viewers. This is a common issue, existing in other generative models
        approaches or content manipulation techniques. Future research in
        generative modeling, and specifically of personalized generative priors,
        must continue investigating and revalidating these concerns.
